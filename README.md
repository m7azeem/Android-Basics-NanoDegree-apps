# Android-Basics-NanoDegree-apps
Apps I made while learning from Udacity's Android Developer NanoDegree.

Apps (both zipped, and in open folders) can be imported to Android Studio.


Notes: 
- The zipped apps are fully tested (on Android API 19) and should work fine.
- As the name states, the apps in the Untested folder aren't fully tested, some of them were only done for trying out differnt techniques.
